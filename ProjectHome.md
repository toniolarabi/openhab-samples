## FYI: This Wiki moved to [Github](https://github.com/openhab/openhab/wiki) ##

This project is the place to be if you are looking for ideas on how to solve a certain use case with openHAB - you will find item definition, sitemaps, binding configurations, rules etc.

This project is meant to be open for any interested party - just ask one of the project owners to provide you write access to the wiki and you will get it! This way, we should be able to quickly build a valuable pool of samples and references.

NOTE: All code posted here is considered to be public domain. So everybody is free to use it in any way he likes. No need to license it, ask for permissions or keep a reference to it.

The wiki structure will also evolve over time - let's start with something simple - [enter the wiki here!](Sidebar.md)
